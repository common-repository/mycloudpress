== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I still own my data? =

Yes you own every part of your data! We just hold it for you, kind of like a cloud for storing your files.

= Do you charge to store my data? =

We have a totally free version. If you exceed the storage limits we do have plans!

= Do you use/distribute anything with my data? =

No we don't use your data in any way accept to show your data to you or restore the data on your behalf! You are fully in control of your data!

= How does it work? =

When you update content or create content it's automatically synced with the cloud. You have peace of mind that if you lose your database you have a copy of it on the cloud! The database is the heart of WordPress!

= I already backup my WordPress? =

That's great you can't have too many ways to get your blog or website back up & running! When you put a ton of hours into blogging & filling the internet with more data you don't want that data to be gone in a matter of seconds! Think of it like your second home!

= Why can't I schedule my backup? =

You don't need a scheduler, it happens in realtime! When you create something it's replicated on the cloud, it's like having your blog or website in two diffrent places but one is shown to the internet & one is private!
